NYC_Green_Taxi_Analysis
==============================

Task
------------
The dataset is available at the following URL and captures green taxi activity in NYC in 2015: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2015-Green-Taxi-Trip-Data/gi8d-wdg5/about

As a general guideline, the objective is to find a few recommendations that you would give to a green taxi driver in NYC.

We would hope that this exercise will help you demonstrate some of the following analytics skills that would make you successful here at CurrencyFair:

· Data acquisition & wrangling

· Data visualisation

· Predictive modelling

There are no restrictions around the tools or methods you can use.

You are of course allowed to enrich the dataset with any other dataset you might find useful.
